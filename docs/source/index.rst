Description
------------

*Simplifies Python application rollout by providing its basic structure.*


This software can function both as a command line tool and as a Python module.


* Make a skeleton for your new application with one console command.
* Automatically create a VCS repository for your application.
* Automatically check whether the chosen application name is not already in use.
* Customize new application layouts with `skeleton templates`.
* Put some skeleton default settings into a configuration file not to mess with command line switches anymore.
