Description
------------

*Simplifies Python application rollout and publishing.*

* Make a skeleton for your new application with one console command.
* Automatically create a VCS repository for your application.
* Automatically check whether the chosen application name is not already in use.
* Customize new application layouts with skeleton templates.
* Put some skeleton default settings into a configuration file not to mess with command line switches anymore.
* Easily add entries to your changelog.
* Publish your application to remotes (VCS, PyPI) with single command.


Application scaffolding
-----------------------

Scaffold a new application:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ makeapp new my_new_app /home/librarian/mynewapp/ -d "My application." --author "The Librarian"


This will create a decent application skeleton (``setup.py``, docs, tests, etc.) and initialize Git repository.


Application publishing
----------------------

When you're ready to publish issue the following command while in project directory (containing ``setup.py``):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ makeapp release


This will automatically:

* bump up application version number
* tag version in VCS
* push sources to remote repository
* upload application package to PyPI


Adding changes
--------------

When you're ready to add another entry to your changelog use ``change`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ makeapp change "+ New 'change' command implemented"

This will also stage and commit all changed files.


Bash completion
---------------

To enable bash completion for ``makeapp`` command append the following line into your ``.bashrc``:

.. code-block:: bash

    eval "$(_MAKEAPP_COMPLETE=source makeapp)"
